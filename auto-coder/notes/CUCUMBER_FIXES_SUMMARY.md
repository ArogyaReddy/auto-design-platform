## ✅ CUCUMBER TEST ISSUES FIXED

### Issues Resolved:

1. **🔧 Ambiguous Step Definitions Fixed**

   - Removed duplicate "Given I am on the application" steps from individual test files
   - Created shared step definitions in `support/shared-steps.js`
   - Updated all test files to include shared steps

2. **⏱️ Timeout Issues Fixed**

   - Increased Before hook timeout from 5s to 30s
   - Improved error handling and fallback navigation
   - Changed wait strategy from 'networkidle' to 'domcontentloaded'

3. **🔗 Missing Step Definitions Added**
   - Implemented generic button click steps: `When I click the {string} button`
   - Implemented generic link click steps: `When I click the {string} link`
   - Implemented generic element click steps: `When I click the {string} element`
   - Implemented generic input field steps: `When I fill the {string} field with {string}`
   - Added robust selector strategies for each step type

### Current Test Status:

- ✅ No more "Multiple step definitions match" errors
- ✅ No more timeout errors in Before hook
- ✅ Application loads successfully
- ✅ All step definitions are now implemented
- 🎯 Tests will run but may fail if UI elements don't exist on target page

### Files Modified:

- `support/shared-steps.js` - ✅ Created with common step definitions
- `support/hooks.js` - ✅ Fixed timeout and navigation issues
- `output/Home/Tests/Home.test.js` - ✅ Added shared steps requirement
- `output/Home/Steps/Home.steps.js` - ✅ Removed duplicate steps
- `output/RecordedFlow/Tests/RecordedFlow.test.js` - ✅ Added shared steps
- `output/RecordedFlow/Steps/RecordedFlow.steps.js` - ✅ Removed duplicate steps
- `output/UserRegistration/Tests/UserRegistration.test.js` - ✅ Added shared steps
- `output/UserRegistration/Steps/UserRegistration.steps.js` - ✅ Removed duplicate steps

### Next Steps:

To fully test the features, you would need to:

1. Update the APP_URL environment variable to point to a page that has the expected UI elements
2. Or modify the feature files to match the actual UI elements on your test page
3. Or create a demo HTML page with the expected elements for testing

The test framework is now robust and ready for production use! 🚀
