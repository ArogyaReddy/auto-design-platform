# ✅ Fixed: Preferences File Location

## Issue Resolved

The `.autodesign-preferences.json` file was being created outside the `auto-design` directory instead of inside it, which was:

- ❌ Causing preferences to not be loaded consistently
- ❌ Creating clutter outside the project directory
- ❌ Making the file location dependent on where the script was run from

## Fix Applied

Updated `interactive-ui.js` to use `__dirname` instead of `process.cwd()`:

### Before (❌ Problematic):

```javascript
const prefPath = path.join(process.cwd(), ".autodesign-preferences.json");
```

### After (✅ Fixed):

```javascript
const prefPath = path.join(__dirname, ".autodesign-preferences.json");
```

## Result

✅ **Preferences file now consistently saved in**: `/auto-design/.autodesign-preferences.json`  
✅ **Works regardless of where the script is run from**  
✅ **Properly ignored by git** (added to `.gitignore`)  
✅ **No more duplicate preference files**

## File Location

```
auto-design/
├── interactive-ui.js
├── .autodesign-preferences.json  ← Now correctly here
├── .gitignore                   ← Updated to ignore this file
└── ...other files
```

## Benefits

- 🎯 **Consistent behavior** - preferences always saved in the same place
- 🗂️ **Clean project structure** - no files outside the project directory
- 🔒 **Privacy protected** - preferences file properly ignored by git
- ⚡ **Reliable defaults** - user preferences consistently loaded and saved

## Testing Verified

✅ Running from inside `auto-design/`: Works correctly  
✅ Running from outside `auto-design/`: Works correctly  
✅ No duplicate files created  
✅ Preferences properly loaded and saved

The preferences system now works reliably regardless of how or where the interactive UI is launched! 🎉
