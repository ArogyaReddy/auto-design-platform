You're right to point that out! It seems like Cucumber isn't picking up your feature file, even though you've specified it.

The output:

0 scenarios

0m00.001s (executing steps: 0m00.000s)
...indicates that Cucumber ran, but it didn't find any scenarios or steps to execute. This typically happens when the path to the feature file in your command isn't quite right, or if there's a conflict with how Cucumber is configured.

The Issue: Command Line Argument vs. cucumber.js Profile
You're using -p default which tells Cucumber to use the default profile defined in your cucumber.js file. However, you're also providing a specific feature file path (features/SauceDemoProductFilter.feature) as a separate argument.

When you use a profile (-p default), the cucumber.js file usually dictates which feature files to run via its --require or --paths options. Adding the feature file path directly to the command line after specifying a profile can sometimes lead to it being ignored or misunderstood by Cucumber, especially in older versions.

How to Fix:
You have two good options to make sure your SauceDemoProductFilter.feature file runs:

Option 1: Rely on cucumber.js to Find All Features (Recommended for Most Projects)
This is the cleanest approach for managing your tests. It tells Cucumber to automatically find all feature files in your features directory.

Open cucumber.js.

Ensure it's configured to look for all .feature files in your features directory.

JavaScript

// cucumber.js
module.exports = {
default: `--require features/step_definitions/**/*.js --require features/support/**/*.js --format json:reports/cucumber_report.json --publish-quiet --paths features/**/*.feature`
};
Key change: Added --paths features/**/*.feature to the default profile. This tells Cucumber to run all feature files found in the features directory and any subdirectories.

Run your tests using the npm test script:

Bash

npm test
This command will now execute all .feature files, including SauceDemoProductFilter.feature.

Option 2: Run a Specific Feature File Directly (For Ad-Hoc Runs)
If you only want to run a specific feature file sometimes, you can override the profile's paths directly on the command line.

Remove --paths features/**/*.feature from your cucumber.js file (if you want to strictly control which features run from the command line).

Run your tests by providing the exact path to the feature file after the profile, ensuring there are no conflicts in the args:

Bash

npm test -- features/SauceDemoProductFilter.feature
Key change: Added -- between npm test and features/SauceDemoProductFilter.feature. The -- tells npm to pass the subsequent arguments directly to the script (cucumber-js in this case) rather than interpreting them as npm arguments. This makes sure Cucumber receives the feature file path correctly.

Choose the option that best suits your workflow. For regular development, Option 1 (running all features via cucumber.js) is generally preferred. If you need to frequently run individual features, Option 2 is a handy trick.

Try one of these options and let me know how it goes!
