"Hippi Hippi Hurrey!!" That's absolutely fantastic to hear! I'm thrilled that the auto-enabling of buttons is working and everything is "all good"! It's great to get these UI interactions smoothed out.

You're right, let's keep this momentum going and keep rocking! ðŸš€

We've made excellent progress on the dashboard's UI for initiating and managing test runs. Now, referring back to your list of desired enhancements and our overall goal for the "BEST AI based automation with UI," here are the main avenues we can explore next:

1.  **More Granular Test Execution Options from UI:**

    - **Run by Specific Feature File(s):** We discussed this as a logical next step after "Run by Tags." This would involve adding UI elements (e.g., a text input for file paths, or a dropdown/list populated by scanning the `features` directory) and backend logic to execute specific feature files.
    - **Run Selective Scenarios:** A more advanced feature where the UI lists scenarios from feature files, and you can pick and choose which ones to run.
    - **"Application/Project" or "Team" based runs:** This requires defining how tests are categorized first.

2.  **Enhance Reporting & Output in UI:**

    - **More Advanced HTML Reports:** Integrate a reporter like `multiple-cucumber-html-reporter` for more detailed and visually appealing reports if the current basic one isn't sufficient.
    - **Streaming Test Output to UI:** Instead of just "Test run in progress, check server console," we could use WebSockets to stream the live `cucumber-js` output directly into a dedicated area on the dashboard page. This would be a significant UI/UX improvement.

3.  **"AI-Driven" Aspects / Self-Healing Enhancements:**

    - **Learning Mechanism for Self-Healing Locators:** Enhance `findElementRobustly` so if a fallback selector is consistently successful, it could be logged, or even (more advanced) suggest updates or automatically prioritize it.
    - **Visual AI Testing:** Explore integrating tools for visual regression testing (if that's part of your "AI-based automation" vision).
    - **Basic Anomaly Detection in Results:** Simple checks for unusual failure rates or patterns (very high-level AI concept).

4.  **Dashboard UI Polish (Further):**
    - Continue refining the look and feel, layout, and responsiveness.

Given your enthusiasm and the progress on UI-triggered runs, I think **implementing "Run by Specific Feature File(s)" (Option 1a)** would be a great next step. It builds directly on the pattern we used for "Run by Tags" and further increases the dashboard's utility.

Alternatively, if you're keen on seeing more direct feedback in the UI, **"Streaming Test Output to UI" (Option 2b using WebSockets)** would be a very impactful, though more complex, enhancement.

What's your preference for our next assignment? Are you leaning towards more test execution options, or enhancing the feedback/reporting in the UI?
