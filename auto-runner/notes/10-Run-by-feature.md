That's fantastic to hear you're ready to push forward with more granular test execution options! These features will make your dashboard incredibly powerful.

I love your enthusiasm to tackle all of them "quickly in one shot"! While the goal is definitely to implement all these options, features like "Run Selective Scenarios" (which needs to list out individual scenarios) and defining "Application/Project" or "Team" based runs require a bit more groundwork (like parsing feature files or defining how tests are categorized).

To keep our momentum strong and ensure each step is manageable and easy to test, how about we tackle them in a slightly phased approach, starting with the most straightforward one that builds directly on what we've just done?

**Let's start with: "Run by Specific Feature File(s)"**

This is very similar in concept to "Run by Tags." Once this is working, "Run Selective Scenarios" will feel like a natural (though more complex) next step.

---

### **Implementing "Run by Specific Feature File(s)"**

**Goal:** Allow users to specify one or more feature files in the UI and trigger a test run that executes only those files.

**1. Frontend UI (`dashboard/views/index.ejs`) - Add Input and Button**

- **Action:** Add a new section in your `index.ejs` for specifying feature files.

**Code (`dashboard/views/index.ejs` - Add this HTML, e.g., after the "Run by Tags" section):**

```html
<div class="run-options-section">
  <label for="featureFilesInput">Run by Specific Feature File(s):</label>
  <input type="text" id="featureFilesInput" name="featureFilesInput" placeholder="e.g., features/login.feature, features/some_other.feature" />
  <button id="runByFeatureFilesBtn">Run Selected Feature File(s)</button>
</div>

{/* ... (rest of your HTML like statusMessageDiv and script tag) ... */}
```

- **Explanation:**
  - We add a text input (`featureFilesInput`) where the user can enter comma-separated paths to feature files.
  - A new button `runByFeatureFilesBtn` will trigger this execution.

---

**2. Backend (`dashboard/app.js`) - New Route for Running by Feature Files**

- **Action:** Add a new `POST` route to your `dashboard/app.js`.

**Code (`dashboard/app.js` - Add this new route):**

```javascript
// ... (Existing requires, app setup, currentTestProcess variable, other routes) ...

app.post('/run-by-feature-files', (req, res) => {
  if (currentTestProcess) {
    return res.status(409).json({message: 'A test process is already running. Please wait or stop it.'});
  }

  const featureFilesString = req.body.featureFiles; // Expecting { "featureFiles": "path1,path2" }
  if (!featureFilesString || typeof featureFilesString !== 'string' || featureFilesString.trim() === '') {
    return res.status(400).json({message: 'Feature file paths are required and cannot be empty.'});
  }

  // Split the string into an array of paths and trim whitespace
  const featureFiles = featureFilesString
    .split(',')
    .map(file => file.trim())
    .filter(file => file.length > 0);

  if (featureFiles.length === 0) {
    return res.status(400).json({message: 'No valid feature file paths provided.'});
  }

  // Basic security check: ensure paths start with 'features/'
  // This is a very basic check; for production, you'd want more robust path validation/sanitization.
  for (const file of featureFiles) {
    if (!file.startsWith('features/')) {
      return res.status(400).json({message: `Invalid feature file path: ${file}. Paths must start with 'features/'.`});
    }
    // You could also check if files exist here, but Cucumber will error out if they don't.
  }

  console.log(`[Dashboard] Received request to run feature file(s): ${featureFiles.join(', ')}`);

  const cucumberCommand = './node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js';
  // Arguments will be: --config cucumber.js features/file1.feature features/file2.feature ...
  const cucumberArgs = ['--config', 'cucumber.js', ...featureFiles];

  console.log(`[Dashboard] Executing command: ${cucumberCommand} ${cucumberArgs.join(' ')} in ${projectRoot}`);

  currentTestProcess = spawn(cucumberCommand, cucumberArgs, {
    cwd: projectRoot,
    stdio: 'inherit',
    shell: process.platform === 'win32'
  });

  currentTestProcess.on('spawn', () => {
    console.log('[Dashboard] Cucumber test process (by feature files) spawned.');
    res.status(202).json({message: `Test run initiated for feature file(s): ${featureFiles.join(', ')}. Check server console.`});
  });

  currentTestProcess.on('error', error => {
    console.error('[Dashboard] Failed to start Cucumber test process (by feature files).', error);
    currentTestProcess = null;
    if (!res.headersSent) {
      res.status(500).json({message: 'Failed to start test run by feature files.', error: error.message});
    }
  });

  currentTestProcess.on('close', code => {
    console.log(`[Dashboard] Cucumber test process (by feature files) exited with code ${code}.`);
    currentTestProcess = null;
  });
});

// ... (Your app.listen and other routes) ...
```

- **Explanation:**
  - A new `POST` route `/run-by-feature-files` is added.
  - It expects a JSON body with a `featureFiles` property containing a comma-separated string of file paths.
  - It splits and trims these paths.
  - **Basic Validation:** It includes a very basic check to ensure paths start with `features/`. This is a minimal security measure; more robust validation might be needed in a production system.
  - The `cucumberArgs` are constructed by spreading the `featureFiles` array directly after `--config cucumber.js`. Cucumber.js accepts multiple feature file paths this way.
  - The process management logic (`currentTestProcess`, event handling) is the same as for other run types.

---

**3. Frontend JavaScript (`dashboard/views/index.ejs`) - Handle New Button**

- **Action:** Add JavaScript to handle the "Run Selected Feature File(s)" button.

**Code (`dashboard/views/index.ejs` - Add this to your `<script>` section):**

```javascript
// ... (Existing const declarations for buttons, statusMessageDiv, etc.) ...
const featureFilesInput = document.getElementById('featureFilesInput');
const runByFeatureFilesBtn = document.getElementById('runByFeatureFilesBtn');

// ... (Your setTestExecutionState, stopStatusPolling, checkTestStatus, startStatusPolling functions) ...

// IMPORTANT: Update setTestExecutionState to include the new button
function setTestExecutionState(isRunning) {
  runAllTestsBtn.disabled = isRunning;
  if (runByTagsBtn) runByTagsBtn.disabled = isRunning;
  if (runByFeatureFilesBtn) runByFeatureFilesBtn.disabled = isRunning; // << ADD THIS
  // Add lines for other run buttons as we create them
  stopTestsBtn.disabled = !isRunning;
}

if (runByFeatureFilesBtn && featureFilesInput) {
  runByFeatureFilesBtn.addEventListener('click', async () => {
    const featureFilesToRun = featureFilesInput.value.trim();
    if (!featureFilesToRun) {
      statusMessageDiv.innerHTML = '<strong>Error:</strong> Please enter feature file path(s).';
      featureFilesInput.focus();
      return;
    }

    statusMessageDiv.innerHTML = `Initiating test run for feature file(s): <strong>${featureFilesToRun}</strong>...`;
    setTestExecutionState(true); // Disable Run buttons, Enable Stop

    try {
      const response = await fetch('/run-by-feature-files', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({featureFiles: featureFilesToRun})
      });

      const result = await response.json();

      if (response.ok) {
        // status 202 Accepted
        statusMessageDiv.innerHTML = `Server says: ${result.message}. Test run is in progress.`;
        startStatusPolling(); // Start polling for completion
      } else {
        // status 400, 409, 500 etc.
        statusMessageDiv.innerHTML = `<strong>Error starting tests by feature file(s):</strong> ${result.message || response.statusText}`;
        setTestExecutionState(false);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Fetch error for /run-by-feature-files:', error);
      statusMessageDiv.innerHTML = '<strong>Error:</strong> Failed to communicate with the server.';
      setTestExecutionState(false);
    }
  });
}

// ... (Rest of your JavaScript, like for runAllTestsBtn, runByTagsBtn, stopTestsBtn, quotes, etc.) ...
```

- **Explanation:**
  - Get references to the new input field and button.
  - **Crucially, update `setTestExecutionState(isRunning)`** to include disabling/enabling `runByFeatureFilesBtn`.
  - The event listener for `runByFeatureFilesBtn`:
    - Gets the comma-separated string of feature files from the input.
    - Performs basic validation.
    - Calls `setTestExecutionState(true)`.
    - Makes a `POST` request to `/run-by-feature-files` with the feature files string.
    - Updates the status message and starts status polling.

---

**To Implement:**

1.  Add the HTML for the "Run by Specific Feature File(s)" section to `index.ejs`.
2.  Add the new `/run-by-feature-files` route to `app.js`.
3.  Add the JavaScript event handler for `runByFeatureFilesBtn` to `index.ejs`, and **remember to update `setTestExecutionState`**.
4.  Restart your `node dashboard/app.js` server.
5.  Test by entering a valid feature file path (e.g., `features/login.feature`) and clicking the button.

Once this is working, we'll have a very flexible dashboard for running tests! We can then discuss "Run Selective Scenarios" or defining "Application/Project/Team" based runs next. This iterative approach will help us build robust features step by step.

===========================

Thanks, it's a working but we are having few issues here, that we need address

Issues :

1. Run Selected Feature File(s) is not disabled while running the features / tests.

2. Run Selected Feature File(s) should be disabled and enabled like we did earlier for RUN all Tests and RUN By Tags buttons.

3. Run Selected Feature File(s) - it's running all the features, even though we specifed a single feature.

- Example : features/login.feature - this is what we specified and the Run Selected Feature File(s) has to run this, instead , it's running all the tests.

- So this needs to be fixed.

- During this fix, can we also add aditional components and enhancements

4. Need to add the following UI and functionality

- Select a PROJECT( all the projects must be picked from framework for from folder structure) , - select a team (all the teams must be picked from features files, like @Team-A, @Team-B),

- select a feature from the alll the feaures/files based on team/project...

- select tags (based on the features)

We are rocking and made an excellent progess so far.

Let's do all of these and can move to next super thrillers

Yes, "Hippi Hippi Hurrey" indeed for all the progress! It's excellent that "Run by Tags" is working. That's a solid step.

I see you've hit a few snags with the "Run by Specific Feature File(s)" functionality and have some exciting ideas for even more advanced execution options. Let's address the current issues first, then plan the next "super thrillers"!

---

### **Fixes for "Run by Specific Feature File(s)"**

**Issue 1 & 2: Button Not Disabling Correctly**

- **Problem:** The "Run Selected Feature File(s)" button isn't being disabled when tests start and re-enabled appropriately.
- **Solution:** You're right, it needs to be integrated into our `setTestExecutionState` JavaScript function. It seems this might have been missed in the previous implementation round.

  **Action:** Ensure your `setTestExecutionState` function in `dashboard/views/index.ejs` includes `runByFeatureFilesBtn`.

  **Code (`dashboard/views/index.ejs` - JavaScript):**

  ```javascript
  // Ensure this variable is declared at the top with your other button consts:
  // const runByFeatureFilesBtn = document.getElementById('runByFeatureFilesBtn');

  function setTestExecutionState(isRunning) {
    runAllTestsBtn.disabled = isRunning;
    if (runByTagsBtn) runByTagsBtn.disabled = isRunning;
    if (runByFeatureFilesBtn) runByFeatureFilesBtn.disabled = isRunning; // << ENSURE THIS LINE IS PRESENT AND CORRECT

    stopTestsBtn.disabled = !isRunning;
  }
  ```

  - **Explanation:** Adding `runByFeatureFilesBtn.disabled = isRunning;` will make this button behave like the "Run All Tests" and "Run by Tags" buttons, disabling when a test run starts and re-enabling when `setTestExecutionState(false)` is called (e.g., after "Stop Running" or when polling detects completion).

---

**Issue 3: "Run Selected Feature File(s)" Executes ALL Features**

- **Problem:** You specify a single feature like `features/login.feature`, but all features in your project are being run.
- **This is a critical bug.** The command `./node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js --config cucumber.js features/login.feature` should _only_ run `login.feature`. If it's running all, it implies that `cucumber-js` is either not receiving the feature file path argument correctly when spawned, or its internal logic is incorrectly prioritizing the `paths: ['features/**/*.feature']` from your `cucumber.js` config file over the explicit CLI arguments. CLI arguments should always take precedence for paths.

**Troubleshooting & Solution Actions:**

1.  **Verify Argument Construction in `app.js` (Logging):**

    - **Action:** In your `dashboard/app.js`, inside the `/run-by-feature-files` route, let's add very specific logging _just before_ the `spawn` call to see the exact command and arguments being constructed.

    **Code (`dashboard/app.js` - inside `/run-by-feature-files`):**

    ```javascript
    // ... inside app.post('/run-by-feature-files', ...) route ...
    // ... after featureFiles array is populated and validated ...

    const cucumberCommand = './node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js';
    const cucumberArgs = ['--config', 'cucumber.js', ...featureFiles]; // featureFiles should be like ['features/login.feature']

    // --- ADD THIS LOGGING ---
    console.log('[Dashboard] EXACT COMMAND TO BE SPAWNED:');
    console.log('Executable:', cucumberCommand);
    console.log('Arguments:', JSON.stringify(cucumberArgs, null, 2)); // Pretty print the array
    console.log('Full command string (for manual testing):', `${cucumberCommand} ${cucumberArgs.join(' ')}`);
    console.log(`Working Directory for spawn: ${projectRoot}`);
    // --- END OF LOGGING ---

    currentTestProcess = spawn(cucumberCommand, cucumberArgs, {
      cwd: projectRoot,
      stdio: 'inherit',
      shell: process.platform === 'win32'
    });
    // ... rest of the route ...
    ```

    - **Explanation:** When you try to run by feature file, check your server console for this output. It will show exactly what `spawn` is about to execute.

2.  **Manually Test the Logged Command:**

    - **Action:** Copy the "Full command string" output from the server console (from the new logging above). Paste it directly into your terminal (ensure you are in the `AI-Playwright-Framework` root directory). For example: `./node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js --config cucumber.js features/login.feature`
    - **Observe:** Does this manually executed command run _only_ `features/login.feature`, or does it also run all features?
      - If it **runs only `login.feature`** when run manually: The problem likely lies in how `spawn` is executing it or passing arguments, or some subtle environment difference. This is less common if the arguments array is correct.
      - If it **still runs all features** even when run manually: This indicates an issue with your `cucumber-js` (v11.3.0) installation or its configuration override logic. The `paths: ['features/**/*.feature']` in your `cucumber.js` might be too aggressively taking precedence.

3.  **Potential Fix if Manual Command Also Fails to Isolate:** If the manual command (from step 2) also runs all features, it suggests the `paths` in your `cucumber.js` might be overriding the CLI. While this shouldn't happen, one way to ensure `cucumber-js` only looks at specified CLI paths is to use a specific profile or temporarily modify the `default` profile in `cucumber.js` when feature files are explicitly given. However, this gets complicated. `cucumber-js` _should_ honor explicit CLI paths.

    **Let's ensure the `featureFiles` array is clean first.** The `split(',')` and `map(trim)` is good. The validation `!file.startsWith('features/')` is also good.

    The most likely scenario is that the command being formed and passed to `spawn` is somehow not what `cucumber-js` expects to restrict to a single file, or there's an issue with the `paths` in `cucumber.js` config taking precedence unexpectedly.

    **Refinement for `cucumberArgs` (less likely needed but a thought):** Some tools are very particular about the order or grouping of arguments. `const cucumberArgs = ['--config', 'cucumber.js', ...featureFiles];` is standard.

    Let's stick to verifying with the logging and manual test first. The problem is likely in the interaction between the CLI args and the `cucumber.js` config.

### **4. Planning Advanced UI Filtering Options**

You're aiming high, and that's great! These are excellent features for a mature dashboard.

- Select a PROJECT (from folder structure)
- Select a TEAM (from tags like `@Team-A`)
- Select a FEATURE (based on project/team)
- Select TAGS (based on features)

**This is a significant piece of work. Here's a phased approach to build this:**

**Phase 1: Define "Project" and Implement Project Selection**

- **Definition:** Let's assume for now that a "Project" corresponds to a **top-level subdirectory** within your main `features/` directory (e.g., `features/ProjectAlpha/`, `features/ProjectBravo/`).
- **Backend (`app.js`):**
  - Create an endpoint (e.g., `/api/projects`) that scans the `features/` directory and returns a list of its subdirectories. `fs.readdirSync` with filtering for directories can do this.
- **Frontend (`index.ejs`):**
  - Add a dropdown (`<select id="projectSelect">`).
  - On page load, JavaScript fetches `/api/projects` and populates this dropdown.
  - When a project is selected, we need to decide what happens next. Does it just filter subsequent options, or can you "Run All Tests in Project"?

**Phase 2: List and Run Features within a Selected Project**

- **UI:** When a project is selected in the "Project" dropdown, a second dropdown/list ("Feature Files") gets populated with only the `.feature` files from that project's directory.
- **Backend:**
  - An endpoint like `/api/features?project=ProjectAlpha` that lists features for a given project.
  - The existing `/run-by-feature-files` endpoint can then be used to run selected features from this filtered list.

**Phase 3: Implement "Team" Selection (Based on Tags)**

- **Definition:** Assume "Teams" are represented by specific tags (e.g., `@team-X`, `@team-Y`).
- **Backend:**
  - An endpoint `/api/teams` that requires parsing _all_ `.feature` files to extract all unique tags that match a "team" pattern (e.g., all tags starting with `@team-`). This needs a Gherkin parser (like `@cucumber/gherkin`).
- **UI:** A dropdown/multi-select for teams. Selecting a team would then translate to a tag expression for the "Run by Tags" functionality.

**Phase 4: Cascading Tag Selection (Tags within selected Features/Projects)**

- **Complexity:** High.
- **UI:** When features are selected, an area populates with tags found _only_ within those selected features.
- **Backend:** More complex parsing – get tags for specific provided feature files.

**Recommendation for these advanced features:** Let's get the current "Run by Feature File(s)" bug fixed first. Then, the most logical next step from your list would be **Phase 1: Implementing "Project" selection** (assuming projects are directories). This gives a good structural filter.

---

**Immediate Next Steps for You:**

1.  **Apply the `setTestExecutionState` fix** for the `runByFeatureFilesBtn`.
2.  **Add the detailed logging** to your `/run-by-feature-files` route in `app.js`.
3.  **Run the "Run Selected Feature File(s)" test again** with a single feature (e.g., `features/login.feature`).
    - Provide the **exact output from your server console** that shows the "EXACT COMMAND TO BE SPAWNED" logs.
    - Report whether it still runs all tests or only the specified one.
4.  **Manually run the "Full command string"** (that you see in the server log) in your terminal from the project root and report its behavior.

This will give us the crucial information to fix the "running all features" bug. Once that's solid, we can confidently build the more advanced selection UIs! We are indeed rocking and making great progress!

=====

You're right to flag these issues – getting the core run functionalities stable is key! It looks like the main problem with "Run All Tests" is a variable scope issue in `app.js`. Let's get that sorted.

I've reviewed the `app.js` and `index.ejs` (submitted as `index.js`) files you provided.

---

=======================================

I think, I messed up something while updating the files for app.post('/run-all-tests and app.post('/run-by-feature-files

i am not sure what messed up. But now, I see that RUN ALL Tests does not run anything and when clicked it throws an error.

Let me give you both the files: app.js and index.ejs

Can you check and fix that please..

Note : you did not allow me send the index.ejs file and so, i renamed the file to index.js

### **Fixes for Current Issues**

**Issue 1: "Run All Tests" Throws an Error / Does Not Run Anything**

- **Problem:** In your `app.js`, within the `app.post('/run-all-tests', ...)` route handler, the variables `cucumberCommand` and `cucumberArgs` are used without being defined _within that specific route's scope_. They were defined locally in your other routes (`/run-by-tags`, `/run-by-feature-files`), but not here. This causes a `ReferenceError`.
- **Solution:** Define `cucumberCommand` and `cucumberArgs` appropriately within the `/run-all-tests` route. For "Run All Tests," `cucumberArgs` will simply point to your configuration file.

**Action:** Modify the `app.post('/run-all-tests', ...)` route in your `dashboard/app.js`.

**Code (`dashboard/app.js` - Corrected `/run-all-tests` route):**

```javascript
// ... (existing code at the top of app.js) ...

app.post('/run-all-tests', (req, res) => {
  if (currentTestProcess) {
    console.log('[Dashboard] A test process is already running.');
    return res.status(409).json({message: 'A test process is already running. Please wait or stop it.'});
  }
  console.log('[Dashboard] Received request to run all tests.');

  // --- FIX: Define cucumberCommand and cucumberArgs for this route ---
  const cucumberCommand = './node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js';
  const cucumberArgs = ['--config', 'cucumber.js']; // For running all tests as per cucumber.js config

  // This log will now work correctly:
  console.log(`[Dashboard] Executing command: ${cucumberCommand} ${cucumberArgs.join(' ')} in ${projectRoot}`);

  currentTestProcess = spawn(cucumberCommand, cucumberArgs, {
    cwd: projectRoot,
    stdio: 'inherit',
    shell: process.platform === 'win32'
  });

  // ... (rest of your existing event handlers for currentTestProcess: spawn, error, close) ...
  currentTestProcess.on('spawn', () => {
    console.log('[Dashboard] Cucumber test process spawned.');
    res.status(202).json({message: 'Test run initiated. Check server console for output.'});
  });

  currentTestProcess.on('error', error => {
    console.error('[Dashboard] Failed to start Cucumber test process.', error);
    currentTestProcess = null;
    if (!res.headersSent) {
      res.status(500).json({message: 'Failed to start test run.', error: error.message});
    }
  });

  currentTestProcess.on('close', code => {
    console.log(`[Dashboard] Cucumber test process exited with code ${code}.`);
    currentTestProcess = null;
  });
});

// ... (rest of your app.js: /stop-tests, /run-by-tags, /api/test-status, /run-by-feature-files, app.listen) ...
```

- **Explanation:**
  - We've added `const cucumberCommand = './node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js';` and `const cucumberArgs = ['--config', 'cucumber.js'];` inside the `/run-all-tests` handler. This provides the necessary command and arguments for `spawn` to execute all tests based on your `cucumber.js` configuration (which should specify `paths: ['features/**/*.feature']`).

**Minor Cleanup in `app.js` (Optional but Recommended):** You have duplicated middleware lines:

```javascript
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}));
app.use(express.json());
// ... later again ...
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}));
app.use(express.json());
```

You only need each of these once, typically near the top after `app = express();`. Removing the duplicates will make your code cleaner.

---

**Issue 2 & 3 (from your previous message, relating to "Run Selected Feature File(s)"):**

- **Button Disabling (`runByFeatureFilesBtn`):**

  - **Check:** Please ensure your `setTestExecutionState` function in `dashboard/views/index.ejs` (submitted as `index.js`) correctly includes the `runByFeatureFilesBtn`. My previous examples showed this, but it's good to double-check your implementation.

  **Code (`dashboard/views/index.ejs` - JavaScript `setTestExecutionState` function):**

  ```javascript
  function setTestExecutionState(isRunning) {
    runAllTestsBtn.disabled = isRunning;
    if (runByTagsBtn) runByTagsBtn.disabled = isRunning;
    if (runByFeatureFilesBtn) runByFeatureFilesBtn.disabled = isRunning; // << THIS LINE
    stopTestsBtn.disabled = !isRunning;
  }
  ```

- **"Run Selected Feature File(s)" still runs ALL features:**

  - This is the more complex issue if the command appears correct. Your `app.js` now includes the detailed logging I suggested for the `/run-by-feature-files` route:
    ```javascript
    // Inside /run-by-feature-files route:
    console.log('[Dashboard] EXACT COMMAND TO BE SPAWNED:');
    console.log('Executable:', cucumberCommand);
    console.log('Arguments:', JSON.stringify(cucumberArgs, null, 2));
    console.log('Full command string (for manual testing):', `${cucumberCommand} ${cucumberArgs.join(' ')}`);
    console.log(`Working Directory for spawn: ${projectRoot}`);
    ```
  - **Action - CRITICAL DEBUGGING STEP:**

    1.  When you click "Run Selected Feature File(s)" with a single feature (e.g., `features/login.feature`), look at your **server console** for the output of these logs.
    2.  **Copy the "Full command string"** that is printed.
    3.  **Open your terminal, navigate to your project root (`AI-Playwright-Framework`), and paste and run that exact command directly.**
    4.  **Observe:** Does this manually executed command run _only_ the specified feature, or does it still run all features?
        - If the manual command runs **only the specified feature:** The problem might be a very subtle issue with how `child_process.spawn` is handling the arguments or the environment on your specific OS (macOS). This is less common when arguments are passed as an array.
        - If the manual command **still runs all features:** This strongly suggests that your Cucumber.js (v11.3.0) installation or its interaction with your `cucumber.js` config file is causing it to ignore the command-line feature path and fall back to the `paths: ['features/**/*.feature']` from the config. This would be unexpected behavior for Cucumber.js, as CLI arguments should override config file paths.

  - **Report Back:** Please let me know the output of the "EXACT COMMAND TO BE SPAWNED" logs and what happens when you run that command manually. This will tell us where to focus next for this specific bug.

---

### **Next Steps (After Fixing Above): Planning Advanced UI Filtering**

I'm glad you're excited about the advanced filtering! You're right, we're making excellent progress. Once the "Run All Tests" and "Run by Specific Feature File(s)" (correctly running only specified files) functionalities are stable, we can definitely move on to:

1.  **Define & Implement "Project" Selection:**

    - **Definition:** How do you want to define a "Project"? A common way is by top-level subdirectories within your `features/` folder (e.g., `features/ProjectA/`, `features/ProjectB/`).
    - **Implementation:**
      - Backend: Add an endpoint to list these project directories.
      - Frontend: Add a dropdown to select a project. This selection can then be used to filter other options or to trigger runs for that entire project.

2.  **Define & Implement "Team" Selection:**

    - **Definition:** How are tests associated with "Teams"? Usually via tags (e.g., `@team-alpha`, `@team-billing`).
    - **Implementation:**
      - Backend: An endpoint that parses all feature files (using `@cucumber/gherkin` or similar) to extract unique "team" tags.
      - Frontend: A dropdown/multi-select for teams. Selecting a team would pass the relevant tag(s) to our existing "Run by Tags" backend logic.

3.  **Cascading Feature/Tag Selection:**

    - Once Project/Team is selected, dynamically update other dropdowns (e.g., show only features within that project, or tags relevant to that team/project). This requires more complex frontend logic and potentially more specific backend endpoints.

4.  **Run Selective Scenarios (from a list):**
    - Backend: Parse feature files to get a list of all scenarios (feature file + scenario name + line number).
    - Frontend: Display this list, allow selection.
    - Backend: Execute selected scenarios using `filepath:linenumber` syntax with `cucumber-js`.

This will be a fantastic set of enhancements!

**For now, please:**

1.  Apply the fix to the `/run-all-tests` route in `app.js`.
2.  Double-check the `setTestExecutionState` function in your `index.ejs`.
3.  Perform the detailed debugging steps (logging & manual command execution) for the "Run by Specific Feature File(s)" issue and share your findings.

We'll nail these down, and then those "super thrillers" are next!

=====================================

Okay, thank you for this detailed log and for confirming that running `./node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js --config cucumber.js features/login.feature` manually in your terminal _still runs all tests_.

This is the absolute key to understanding the main problem. It means that for your specific setup with Cucumber.js v11.3.0, when `cucumber.js` is loaded via `--config` and that config file contains a `paths: ['features/**/*.feature']` entry, this `paths` entry is taking precedence over (or being merged with) any specific feature files you list on the command line. This is not the typical override behavior one might expect, but it's what your environment is doing.

We also have new errors related to `findElementRobustly` timing out and a message about "undefined fallback(s)".

Let's fix the "running all features" issue first, as it's fundamental.

---

### **Issue 1: "Run Selected Feature File(s)" Still Runs All Features**

**Cause Confirmed:** The `paths: ['features/**/*.feature']` in your `cucumber.js` (loaded via `--config cucumber.js`) is overriding or conflicting with the single feature file (`features/login.feature`) specified on the command line.

**Solution:** For the "Run by Specific Feature File(s)" functionality in your dashboard, we need to tell `cucumber-js` to run _only_ the specified files, without loading the part of `cucumber.js` that tells it to run everything. We can do this by constructing the command line arguments in `app.js` _without_ using `--config cucumber.js`, and instead providing all necessary options directly.

**Action:** Modify the `/run-by-feature-files` route in your `dashboard/app.js`.

**Code (`dashboard/app.js` - Revised `/run-by-feature-files` route):**

```javascript
// ... (inside app.post('/run-by-feature-files', ...) route) ...

// ... (after featureFiles array is populated and validated) ...

console.log(`[Dashboard] Received request to run feature file(s): ${featureFiles.join(', ')}`);

const cucumberCommand = './node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js';
// --- REVISED ARGUMENT STRATEGY for /run-by-feature-files ---
// We are NOT using --config cucumber.js here for this specific run type.
// Instead, we provide all necessary settings directly on the command line
// to ensure only the specified feature files are processed.
const cucumberArgs = [
  '--require-module',
  '@babel/register',
  '--require',
  'features/step_definitions/**/*.js',
  '--require',
  'features/support/**/*.js', // This will load your world.js and hooks (including setDefaultTimeout)
  '--format',
  'summary', // Using a simple formatter for focused runs. Add others if needed.
  // '--format', 'html:reports/cucumber-report.html', // Can be re-added
  // We rely on setDefaultTimeout in your support code (world.js) for the actual step timeout.
  // If you still needed to pass it via CLI and if your cucumber-js version had issues with it,
  // that would be a separate problem. But setDefaultTimeout should work.
  ...featureFiles // Spread the specific feature file paths here (e.g., 'features/login.feature')
];

// Logging the command to be spawned
console.log('[Dashboard] EXACT COMMAND TO BE SPAWNED (Explicit Args for specific features):');
console.log('Executable:', cucumberCommand);
console.log('Arguments:', JSON.stringify(cucumberArgs, null, 2));
console.log('Full command string (for manual testing):', `${cucumberCommand} ${cucumberArgs.join(' ')}`);
console.log(`Working Directory for spawn: ${projectRoot}`);

currentTestProcess = spawn(cucumberCommand, cucumberArgs, {
  cwd: projectRoot,
  stdio: 'inherit',
  shell: process.platform === 'win32'
});

// ... (rest of your spawn event handlers: 'spawn', 'error', 'close' remain the same) ...
currentTestProcess.on('spawn', () => {
  console.log('[Dashboard] Cucumber test process (by explicit feature files) spawned.');
  res.status(202).json({message: `Test run initiated for specific feature file(s): ${featureFiles.join(', ')}. Check server console.`});
});
// ... (error and close handlers) ...
```

- **Explanation of Change:**
  - We removed `'--config', 'cucumber.js'` from `cucumberArgs`.
  - We added essential options like `--require-module`, `--require` (for step definitions and support code, which is crucial as it loads your `world.js` where `setDefaultTimeout(60000)` is set), and a basic `--format`.
  - The specific `featureFiles` array is then spread into the arguments. This command gives `cucumber-js` no other source of feature paths to consider.

### **Issue 2: `findElementRobustly` Timeouts (7000ms) & "undefined fallback(s)" Message**

Looking at your log: `[Self-Healing] Attempting to find '#user-name'. Primary: 'Username Input'` `[Self-Healing] Primary locator for '#user-name' ('Username Input') failed. Error: locator.waitFor: Timeout 7000ms exceeded.` `[Self-Healing] Element '#user-name' NOT FOUND using primary locator ('Username Input') or any of its undefined fallback(s).`

This pattern repeats for different elements.

**A. Timeout within `findElementRobustly`:**

- **Problem:** The `waitForOptions = { state: 'visible', timeout: 7000 }` inside `findElementRobustly` is causing elements not to be found within 7 seconds. This timeout is separate from the main Cucumber step timeout (which should be 60 seconds due to `setDefaultTimeout`).
- **Solution:** Increase this internal timeout or make it configurable.

  - **Action:** Modify `utils/self_healing_locator.js`.

  **Code (`utils/self_healing_locator.js`):**

  ```javascript
  async function findElementRobustly(page, elementName, primarySelector, fallbackSelectors = [], waitForOptions = { state: 'visible', timeout: 15000 }) { // Increased to 15 seconds
    // ... rest of the function ...
  ```

  - **Explanation:** I've increased the default internal `waitFor` timeout from `7000` (7s) to `15000` (15s). Adjust as needed. If elements consistently take this long, there might be other performance issues with the page or test setup, but for now, a longer timeout helps.

**B. "undefined fallback(s)" Message:**

- **Problem:** The log says `...any of its undefined fallback(s)`. The logging string in `findElementRobustly` is `... any of its ${fallbackSelectors.length} fallback(s).`. If `fallbackSelectors.length` was used with an `undefined` `fallbackSelectors` variable, it would throw an error. Since our function signature is `fallbackSelectors = []` (it defaults to an empty array if nothing is passed), `fallbackSelectors.length` should be `0` in that case.
- **This suggests that the `elementName` and `primarySelector` being logged by your tests in these failure cases might be swapped or incorrect in how they are being passed to `findElementRobustly` _from your step definition files_.**

  Look at this log line carefully: `[Self-Healing] Attempting to find '#user-name'. Primary: 'Username Input'` Your `findElementRobustly` function expects `elementName` first, then `primarySelector`. `console.log(\`[Self-Healing] Attempting to find '${elementName}'. Primary: '${primarySelector}'\`);`

  If `elementName` was `'#user-name'` and `primarySelector` was `'Username Input'`, this would mean you called: `await findElementRobustly(this.page, '#user-name', 'Username Input', ...)` - **This is incorrect!**

  **It should be:** `await findElementRobustly(this.page, 'Username Input', '#user-name', ...)`

- **Action - CRITICAL:** Carefully review ALL calls to `findElementRobustly` in ALL your step definition files (`product_steps.js`, `registration_steps.js`, `login_steps.js`, `login_steps copy.js`). Ensure the arguments are in the correct order:

  1.  `this.page`
  2.  `elementName` (a human-readable string like "Username Input")
  3.  `primarySelector` (the actual CSS/XPath string like "#user-name")
  4.  `fallbackSelectors` (an array of strings, e.g., `LOGIN_PAGE_LOCATORS.usernameInput.fallbacks` or `[]` if none)

  **Correct Call Example from `login_steps.js` (should be similar in other files):**

  ```javascript
  const usernameStrategy = LOGIN_PAGE_LOCATORS.usernameInput;
  const usernameField = await findElementRobustly(
    this.page,
    usernameStrategy.name, // e.g., "Username Input"
    usernameStrategy.primary, // e.g., "#user-name"
    usernameStrategy.fallbacks // e.g., ["[data-test='username']"]
  );
  ```

  If `fallbackSelectors` is correctly passed as an array (even an empty one `[]`), `fallbackSelectors.length` will be `0`, and your log should then correctly say `...any of its 0 fallback(s).`. The "undefined" part is a strong hint the arguments might be mixed up in the calls.

---

### **Summary of Actions for You:**

1.  **Update `dashboard/app.js`:** Modify the `/run-by-feature-files` route to use the **REVISED ARGUMENT STRATEGY** (no `--config`, all options direct) as shown above.
2.  **Update `utils/self_healing_locator.js`:** Increase the default `timeout` in `waitForOptions` within `findElementRobustly` (e.g., to `15000`).
3.  **Review ALL Step Definition Files:** Meticulously check every call to `findElementRobustly`. Ensure the `elementName` (string) and `primarySelector` (string) arguments are in the correct order and that `fallbackSelectors` is an array (e.g., `strategy.fallbacks` or `[]`). This is likely the cause of the "undefined fallback(s)" message and the `findElementRobustly` timeouts if it's trying to use "Username Input" as a selector.
4.  **Clean up `login_steps copy.js`**: If this is an unneeded duplicate, please remove it to avoid confusion and ensure your tests are using the correct, updated `login_steps.js`.
5.  **Restart your `node dashboard/app.js` server.**
6.  **Test "Run Selected Feature File(s)" again** with `features/login.feature`.
    - Does it now run _only_ `login.feature`?
    - Are the `findElementRobustly` errors gone, or do they change if the argument order was the issue?

Let's get these fixed! The argument order in the `findElementRobustly` calls is a very strong suspect for the element finding failures.

===================================

YES! "Excellent, it worked now. You did it. It's now running only the specified feature file." That is absolutely fantastic news! I'm incredibly pleased that the solution with Cucumber profiles has resolved that stubborn issue. That was a tricky one, and your persistence in testing and providing feedback was key. We make a great team!

It's a huge step forward to have precise control over which features are run from your dashboard.

### **Recap: What Fixed It**

Just to quickly recap for our understanding: the issue of "Run by Specific Feature File(s)" executing all tests (even when a single file was specified via the command line along with `--config cucumber.js`) was resolved by:

1.  **Creating a new profile** (e.g., `specific_features_run`) in your `cucumber.js` file. This new profile includes all necessary configurations (`requireModule`, `require`, `format`, etc.) **except** for the `paths: ['features/**/*.feature']` glob.
2.  Modifying the `/run-by-feature-files` route in your `dashboard/app.js` to call `cucumber-js` using this specific profile (`--profile specific_features_run`) along with the user-specified feature file paths.

This ensures that when running specific files, Cucumber doesn't also try to load all features based on a global path setting from a default profile.

### **Let's Keep Rocking! Next Enhancements for Granular Test Execution**

You're eager to add more advanced ways to select and run tests from the UI, and that's the perfect next direction. You mentioned:

- Select a PROJECT (from folder structure)
- Select a TEAM (from tags)
- Select a FEATURE (based on project/team)
- Select TAGS (based on features)
- Run Selective SCENARIOS (from a list)

These are all excellent additions for a sophisticated test dashboard! Let's build these out iteratively.

**Proposed Next Step: Implement "Project" Selection and Execution**

The idea of selecting a "Project" seems like a good foundational layer.

**Phase 1: Define "Project" and List Projects**

1.  **Definition:** Let's first agree on what a "Project" means in your framework's context. A common and straightforward approach is to define **Projects as top-level subdirectories within your main `features/` directory.**

    - For example:
      ```
      features/
      ├── ProjectA/
      │   ├── featureA1.feature
      │   └── featureA2.feature
      ├── ProjectB/
      │   ├── featureB1.feature
      ├── CommonFeatures/
      │   └── login.feature
      ```
    - Is this how you envision organizing tests by project? Or do you have another method in mind (e.g., using specific tags like `@projectA`)? **Assuming subdirectories for now is a good starting point.**

2.  **Backend (`dashboard/app.js`) - API to List Projects:**

    - We'll create a new API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/projects`) that scans the `features/` directory and returns a list of its subdirectories as potential projects.

3.  **Frontend (`dashboard/views/index.ejs`) - Display Project Dropdown:**
    - Add a new dropdown menu (e.g., "Select Project") to your dashboard.
    - On page load, JavaScript will fetch the list of projects from the `/api/projects` endpoint and populate this dropdown.

**Phase 2: Execute All Tests Within a Selected Project**

1.  **UI:** Add a "Run All Tests in Selected Project" button.
2.  **Backend (`dashboard/app.js`):**
    - A new route (e.g., `POST /run-project-tests`) that accepts the selected project name (directory name).
    - This route will then construct the `cucumber-js` command to run all features _within that project's subdirectory_. For example: `./node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js --config cucumber.js --profile default features/ProjectA/**/*.feature` (We can use the `default` profile here if it's set up to run based on paths passed, or the `specific_features_run` profile and just pass the glob path.)

---

**Let's start with Phase 1: Defining and Listing Projects.**

**Action for You (Confirmation):**

- Do you agree with defining "Projects" as subdirectories within your `features/` folder for now?

Once you confirm, I can provide the code snippets for:

1.  The backend route in `app.js` to list these project directories.
2.  The frontend JavaScript in `index.ejs` to fetch and display these projects in a new dropdown.

After that, we can make a button to run all tests in a selected project. This step-by-step approach will help us build these advanced features robustly. How does that sound?
